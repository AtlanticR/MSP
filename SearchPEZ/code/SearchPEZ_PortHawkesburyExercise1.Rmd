###**Potential Exposure Zones (PEZs) polygon**

**Site:**
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(AquaSiteName)
```

This report was prepared by the MSP and PIER teams for the Point Tupper Maeine Services Corporation (PTMSC) oil spill exercise held on June 17, 2020, and to evaluate its potential use for spill incidents. A polygon surrounding the spill areas (Predicted Exposure Zone: PEZ) was used to search regional databases (**2002 - 2018**) and summarize species that have been recorded. Species lists generated in this synthesis is subsequently circulated to emergency responders in Maritimes Science to verify and compliment the information provided (e.g. spatial and temporal presence/absence of species in the area). 

Map below shows the PEZ polygon (blue) used to search regional databases and summarize recorded species.


```{r Fig 1 PEZ polygon, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
site_map(PEZ_poly,site,land,40)
```

# **Regional Databases**

```{r read csv extracted with previous chunck, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
fl <- list.files(dataPath,".csv")
marfis <- read.csv(file.path(dataPath,fl[grep("marfis_",fl)]))
marfis <- marfis[which(year(marfis$DATE_FISHED)>=minYear),]
# isdb <- read.csv(file.path(dataPath,fl[grep("isdb_",fl)]))
# isdb <- isdb[which(year(isdb$DATE_TIME2)>=minYear),]
# rv <- read.csv(file.path(dataPath,fl[grep("rv_",fl)]))
# rv <- rv[which(year(rv$SDATE)>=minYear),] 
```

### **Ecosystem Research Vessel (RV) Survey**

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has conducted Research Vessel (RV) surveys in the Maritimes Region using a standardized protocol. For more information see <https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/4062092x.pdf>. The search of the Ecosystem RV Survey database resulted in no records. 

### **Industry Survey Database (ISDB)**

ISDB is a DFO database that contains at-sea fish catch observations from commercial fishing vessels operating in the North West Atlantic.The search of the ISDB resulted in no records. 

### **The Maritime Fishery Information System (MARFIS)**

MARFIS is a DFO database, managed by the Policy and Economics Branch, that houses information on the fisheries of the Maritimes Region. This fishery monitoring information represents a complete census of almost all commercial fishing activities.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
marfis$database <- "marfis"
marfis_freq <- aggregate(
        x = list(Records = marfis$SPECIES_NAME),
      by = list(Species = marfis$SPECIES_NAME
      ),
      length
      )
marfis_freq <- marfis_freq[order(-marfis_freq$Records),]
rownames(marfis_freq) <- c()

marfis_total <- aggregate(
  x = list(total = marfis$COMM),
  by = list(db = marfis$database
  ),
  length
)
Total_number_records_MARFIS <- marfis_total[[2]] 
Total_number_records_MARFIS 
```
The search of MARFIS resulted in the Table below that summarizes records by species or species group. Records were cropped to match PEZ. 


```{r}
kable(as.data.frame(Total_number_records_MARFIS), digits=2, full_width = F, position = "float_left") 
```
```{r}
kable(marfis_freq) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```
Map below shows the location of samples recorded in the MARFIS database (records are summarized in the tables/sections above). The yellow polygon shows the locations of the theoretical oil spill site. The blue polygon displays the PEZ used for this synthesis. Records were cropped to match PEZ. 

```{r Fig 3 MARFIS and ISDB records, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
site_map(PEZ_poly,site,land,2)
points(marfis$ENT_LONGITUDE,marfis$ENT_LATITUDE, col="black",pch=16,cex=0.5)
#points(isdb$LONG2,isdb$LAT2, col="black",pch=16,cex=0.5)
```

### **Whale Sightings Database **

Most sightings are collected on an opportunistic basis and observations may come from individuals with a variety of expertise in marine mammal identification experiences. Most data have been gathered from platforms of opportunity that were vessel-based. For more information please contact Pamela.Emery@dfo-mpo.gc.ca

Map below shows location of marine mammals sightings recorded in the Fisheries and Oceans whale sightings database. Map includes SARA and COSEWIC species within the region of interest. The yellow polygon shows the locations of the theoretical oil spill site. The blue polygon displays the PEZ used for this synthesis. 

```{r read wsdb and filter SARA & COSEWIC cetacean spp, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
wsdb <- read.csv(wsdbFile)
wsdb <- wsdb[which(year(as.Date(wsdb$WS_DATE,"%d-%b-%Y"))>=minYear),]
#wsdb <- remove_landPoints(wsdb,land)
wsdb_filter <- filter_wsdb(wsdb)
```
```{r Fig 4 Whale Sightings Database, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar=c(0, 0, 5.5, 0) + 2)#it goes c(bottom, left, top, right)
site_map(PEZ_poly,site,land,5)
plot_wsdb(PEZ_poly,wsdb_filter,5)
```

# **Resources**

### **Sources of Uncertainty**

Coastal areas are generally not adequately sampled on spatial and temporal scales of most relevance to oil spill incidents, i.e. tens to hundreds of meters and hours to months, and hence information on these space and time scales is generally not contained within the various data sources available to DFO, including the surveys referred to in this document. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to the exact distribution of species in the area of the theoretical oil spill.

MARFIS and ISDB do not fully sample the region spatially or temporally and, therefore, additional information on presence and habitat use (i.e. spawning, migration, feeding) must be drawn from larger-scale studies. 

The marine mammal sightings database has inherent problems with negative or positive reactions by cetaceans to the approach of such vessels that have not yet been factored into the data. Sighting effort has not been quantified (i.e., the numbers cannot be used to estimate true species density or abundance for an area). Lack of sightings do not represent lack of species present in a particular area. Numbers sighted have not been verified (especially in light of the significant differences in detectability among species). For completeness, the data represent an amalgamation of sightings from a variety of years and seasons.
