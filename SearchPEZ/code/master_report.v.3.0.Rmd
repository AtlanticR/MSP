# **Introduction**

### **About this report**

This reproducible report summarizes species that have been reported in specific areas drawing from databases available, both within and outside the Department. This report provides a general list of priority species (listed by SARA, COSEWIC and Wild Species) that have been reported in a given user defined area. This report is for internal DFO use only. No maps, layers, or data that violate the rule of 5 will be shared outside of the department. 

**Species listings reported in this section:**

*SARA* - The Species at Risk Act (SARA) was proclaimed in June 2003, and is one part of a three part Government of Canada strategy for the protection of wildlife species at risk. This three part strategy also includes commitments under the Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk and activities under the Habitat Stewardship Program for Species at Risk. The purposes of SARA are to prevent Canadian indigenous species, subspecies, and distinct populations from becoming extirpated or extinct, to provide for the recovery of endangered or threatened species, and encourage the management of other species to prevent them from becoming at risk. It applies to all federal lands in Canada; all wildlife species listed as being at risk; and their critical habitat.
For more information on SARA visit <https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/species-risk-public-registry.html> 

*COSEWIC* - The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) is an independent advisory panel to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada that meets twice a year to assess the status of wildlife species at risk of extinction. Members are wildlife biology experts from academia, government, non-governmental organizations and the private sector responsible for designating wildlife species in danger of disappearing from Canada. COSEWIC determines the national status of wild Canadian species, subspecies, varieties or other designatable units that are suspected of being at risk of extinction or extirpation. COSEWIC uses a process based on science and Aboriginal or community knowledge to assess wildlife species at risk. All native mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, arthropods, molluscs, vascular plants, mosses and lichens are included in COSEWIC's current mandate.
For more information on COSEWIC visit <https://www.cosewic.ca/index.php/en-ca/>

*Wild species* - Every five years the National General Status Working Group (NGSWG), which includes representatives from all provincial and territorial governments in Canada, and from the federal government, publishes a general report on the status of wildlife species in Canada. These reports are meant to inform Canadians about the status of species in the country, and to help prevent species in Canada from becoming extinct as a consequence of human activity.

### **How to use this report**

Absence of a species in this report should be interpreted as an absence of reporting, not as an absence of the species in the area. The focus of this report is on species presence and not on associated numbers, frequency, or catch information.The aquaculture Science group led by Fred Page works with the Aquaculture site information, including current meter data, to calculate the Potential Exposure Zones (PEZ) of the aquaculture inputs (depositional feed/feces, advective/dispersive fish health treatments, etc.). This PEZ polygon is then used in this document to search regional databases (2002 - 2018) and summarize species that have been recorded. This information is used to determine if other, more site-specific, information is available on species presence for PEZ as a complement to the information provided by the proponent. Species lists generated in this synthesis is subsequently circulated to units in Maritimes Science to verify and compliment the information provided (e.g. spatial and temporal presence/absence of species in the area). 

### **Intent of this report**

The intent of this report for all users is to prompt a circulation of the species list generated in this synthesis to appropriate DFO units and sectors to verify and supplement the information provided (e.g. reported spatial and temporal presence/absence of species in the area).

### **Resources and Sources of Uncertainty**

Coastal and offshore areas of the Scotian Shelf bioregion are generally not adequately sampled, and hence information on these space and time scales is generally not contained within the various data sources available to DFO, including the surveys referred to in this document. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to the exact distribution of species in the search.

### **Tiers of confidence in data sources**

There are various data sources featured in this report, including federal and provincial agencies, non-proft organizations and citizen groups. Below is a framework by which users can assess the confidence with which they can assess the different data sources provided throughout the report.

### **Species At Risk Distribution Range**  

URL: <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/e0fabad5-9379-4077-87b9-5705f28c490b>  
Tier of confidence: **High**  

The Species at Risk (SAR) Program is responsible for carrying out DFO’s mandate under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) to protect, recover and conserve all listed aquatic SAR in Canada. As part of this mandate, this spatial database has been developed to identify areas in which aquatic species listed under SARA may be found.

Distribution and range information are identified for species listed as Endangered, Threatened or Special Concern under SARA.

Distribution (range) polygons and lines were assembled by regional SARA biologists using the best available information, including COSEWIC status reports, recovery potential assessments, academic literature, and expert opinion. These spatial data support the protection, recovery and conservation of species listed as Endangered, Threatened or Special Concern under SARA. Species distributions are also described and displayed in Recovery Strategies, Action Plans and/or Management Plans.

Discrepancies may exist between the distribution data shown in a species’ SARA recovery document and the current spatial data. Please contact DFO for more information on any data discrepancies.

### **Species at Risk Critical Habitat** 

**URL:** <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/db177a8c-5d7d-49eb-8290-31e6a45d786c>  
Tier of confidence: **High**  

The Species at Risk (SAR) Program is responsible for carrying out DFO’s mandate under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) to protect, recover and conserve all listed aquatic SAR in Canada.

Critical habitat is identified for species listed as Endangered or Threatened under the Species at Risk Act (SARA).

Critical habitat is defined under section 2 of SARA as: "the habitat that is necessary for the survival or recovery of a listed wildlife species and that is identified as the species' critical habitat in the recovery strategy or in an action plan for the species". Section 49(1)(a) of SARA requires that a species' Recovery Strategy/Action Plan include an identification of the species' critical habitat to the extent possible, based on the best available information, including information provided by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). SARA makes it illegal to destroy any part of the critical habitat of SAR and may impose restrictions on development and construction.

Critical habitats were assembled by SARA regional biologists and recovery teams. They are designed to support the protection and recovery of species listed as Endangered or Threatened under the Species at Risk Act. They are also described and displayed in species' Recovery Documents and Action Plans.

The Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) ecosystem surveys consist of research vessel survey data collected to monitor the distribution and abundance of fish and invertebrates throughout the Scotian Shelf, Bay of Fundy and Georges Bank. The surveys follow a stratified random sampling design, and include sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl. These survey data are the primary data source for monitoring trends in species distribution, abundance, and biological condition within the region, and also provide data to the Atlantic Zonal Monitoring Program (AZMP) for monitoring hydrographic variability. Collected data includes total catch in numbers and weights by species. Length frequency data is available for most species, as are the age, sex, maturity and weight information for a subset of the individual animals. 

The RV survey data set consists of data collected during the following 4 separate annual surveys:

The Industry Survey Database (ISDB) is a DFO database that contains at-sea fish catch observations from commercial fishing vessels operating in the North West Atlantic. The data provided by ISDB is confidential and cannot be communicated outside of the DFO, given the direct implications of the Rule of 5. Industry surveys do not fully sample the region spatially or temporally and, therefore, additional information on presence and habitat use (i.e. spawning, migration, feeding) must be drawn from larger-scale studies. 

Remember that fisheries catch and effort information  
for an individual licence holder, is considered personal information and is protected under section 19 of the Access to Information Act <https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-12>, 
and for a corporate licence holder, is considered to be sensitive, proprietary information and protected under Section 20 of the Access to Information Act <https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-13>  

Without written consent, DFO is not permitted to release information or data products (e.g., maps and data layers) that might reveal personal or third party information such as catch, landed values, and vessel-specific fishing locations.  All of this is spelled out to DFO staff here - Informal Release Guidelines (i.e. Appendix B – “Catch and Effort and Quota Information: Do’s and Don’ts for Informal Release” <\\ent.dfo-mpo.ca\ATLShares\Shared\ATIP Information\Informal_Release_Guidelines-eng.docx>).

The Maritime Fishery Information System (MARFIS) is a DFO database, managed by the Policy & Economics Branch. MARFIS contains: catch and effort, quota, and licensing information for the Maritimes region. The catch and effort data contains the log information for all commercial fisheries that land within this region. If a Maritimes region commercial vessel lands in another DFO region or outside of Canadian waters, it is not included in the database. The majority of catch information is related to commercial offloads. MARFIS does not fully sample the region spatially or temporally and, therefore, additional information on presence and habitat use (i.e. spawning, migration, feeding) must be drawn from larger-scale studies. There is also more limited data related to discards and the SARA log. Not all catch records have associated lat/long coordinates. This may be due to the structure of the log itself, or missing data. Generally all records have a NAFO Division and NAFO Unit Area flag, even if no coordinates have been provided. Data for the years 2017-2020 is preliminary and subject to change without notice. There may be some limited changes to data in the years 2016 and previous. Ongoing qa/qc work is done on the MARFIS database, but not all errors are corrected. If you have data errors, questions, or corrections, you can send them to our data quality inbox: CDDDataQuality@dfo-mpo.gc.ca. Requests for data exports can be sent to: XMARComData@dfo-mpo.gc.ca.

OBIS is a global open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation and sustainable development. Their vision is to build and maintain a global alliance that collaborates with scientific communities to facilitate free and open access to, and application of, biodiversity and biogeographic data and information on marine life. OBIS search was conducted to find additional relevant records for listed by SARA, or assessed by COSEWIC and Wild species listing. Subsequent versions of this report will aim at expanding our QC efforts for this source of information.

This section summarizes information available from visual sightings and modeled predictions of suitable habitat to identify cetacean species in the search area. While numerous species have been identified in this region, only those listed by SARA, or assessed by COSEWIC and Wild species listings are summarized. Outputs include results from cetacean surveys conducted over previous years in both Canadian and American waters in the northwest Atlantic. However, the majority of cetacean sightings for the Scotian Shelf bioregion are opportunistic in nature, and comprehensive systematic surveys on the occurrence or distribution of cetaceans across the entire region are very limited. Results in this report can provide some information on distribution, but cannot be interpreted as comprehensive indices of abundance as they often do not cover the entirety of a species’ range. A future comprehensive analysis of any associated observational effort for these data is necessary to fully characterize cetacean distribution in the area over temporal and spatial scales. Consequently, outputs of this report indicate species presence only, and an absence of a species in an area should be interpreted as an absence of reporting not as an absence of the species in the area.

This section does not endeavor to describe every source of information provided below. Please refer to the publications listed below for additional information and please contact Angelia Vanderlaan (North Atlantic right whales) and Hilary Moors-Murphy (beaked and other baleen whales) to consider additional sources of information (e.g. acoustic detections) to support species-specific conclusions about habitat preferences and possible or known occurrence near and within the search area. This report does not provide the best available information for North Atlantic right whales; please refer to WHALEMAP for the latest North Atlantic right whale observations: https://whalemap.ocean.dal.ca/ Note that WhaleMap (Johnson 2018) reports primarily presence-only datasets and only reflects results for areas that are being monitored.

The following information is summarized in the NARWC sightings database site <https://www.narwc.org/sightings-database.html>. The Sightings database contains records of thousands of sightings of right whales in the North Atlantic Ocean, as well as sightings of many other species of whales, dolphins, sea turtles, seals, and large fishes. It also contains survey data associated with many of these sightings that allow quantification of associated survey effort (note that the database does not include interpreted effort data as such). The sightings contained in the database come from a wide variety of contributors both Consortium members and others. Each record in the Sightings database represents a group of whales (i.e., a group of 3 whales has a single record just as a group of 1 does) and there may or may not be photographic proof of a given right whale sighting. The Sightings and Identification databases are periodically cross-referenced, so that individual identification data from the latter can be linked to sighting data from the former. For that reason, all sightings in the Identification database are eventually included in the Sightings database (with an approximate 1-year lag). Although the animals' identifications are not included in the Sightings database, the two databases can be linked on common fields. This review article of the Sightings Database provides potential users with important information.

The following information is summarized in this site (https://whiteheadlab.weebly.com/). The Whitehead Lab is based out of the Dalhousie University Department of Biology (Halifax, Nova Scotia). Since its inception in 1987, the Whitehead Lab has been home to over 75 postdoctoral, Ph.D., M.Sc., and undergraduate students. They primarily conduct conservation-based research on the behavior, ecology, and population biology of cetacean species (primarily, sperm whales, northern bottlenose whales, and long-finned pilot whales). The following is extracted from Whitehead (2013): data in this section is from incidental sightings of cetaceans during studies of northern bottlenose whales and, to a lesser extent, sperm whales in the northwest Atlantic, primarily in the Gully MPA, and adjacent canyons along the edge of the eastern Scotian Shelf (the Shortland Canyon and the Haldimand Canyon). Data collection is carried out in a comparable manner, and from two similar research vessels: a 10 m auxiliary sailing vessel, or a 13 m auxiliary sailing vessel. All groups of cetaceans sighted are recorded, together with time of sighting, species (where ascertainable), and position. As definitions of group size changed over the course of the study, sightings are very inaccurate and biased by factors such as the behaviour of the animals and the weather. Consequently, Whitehead (2013) only used group sighting data, rather than numbers of individuals. The Whitehead Lab provides cetacean sightings to the Whale Sightings Database (WSDB) at DFO. However, due to its high tier of confidence, this database is summarized independently in this report.

The Marine Mammal and Pelagic Animals or Whale Sighting Database (WSDB) was implemented in 2002 by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) to provide a central repository for opportunistic sightings of marine animals, especially cetaceans, and to improve accessibility to data from a variety of sources, including some data from marine mammal surveys and research activities conducted in the Bay of Fundy, on the Scotian Shelf (MacDonald et al. 2017), and more recently in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Most sightings are collected on an opportunistic basis and observations come from individuals with a wide range of expertise and experience in marine mammal identification. Most data is gathered from platforms of opportunity that were vessel-based. For more information see <https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40642999.pdf>.

Note the following details about the data provided: 
-sightings with Behaviour coded as “dead”, “killed” or “stranded”  are not included.
-sightings with Animal Condition coded as "dead" are not included.
-sightings with Gear Impact recorded coded as  "Entangled - dead on gear" or "dead - not entangled"  are not included.

Please note the following important disclaimers for WSDB:
- Sighting effort has not been quantified (i.e., the data cannot be used to estimate true species density or abundance for an area).
- The sightings data are biased by when and where activities occur. Species absence in an area should be interpreted as an absence of reporting not as an absence of the species in the area.
- The sighting data have not been completely error-checked and may contain duplicate records.
- The quality of some of the sighting data is unknown. Most sightings are collected on an opportunistic basis and observations come from individuals with a wide range of expertise and experience in marine mammal identification. 
- There is significant uncertainty in the number of animals sighted per detection due to the challenges associated with quantifying the number of individuals observed in a group.
- The data represent an amalgamation of sightings across years and seasons. The sightings data are biased by when and where activities were conducted, thus, the sighting effort is not consistent across months, years or, areas. Therefore, apparent differences in seasonal or annual distribution  patterns in the sightings data should not be considered definitive. Unfavorable weather and reduced visual effort in winter, spring, and autumn likely account for the fewer sighting records in these seasons compared to summer.
- Many sightings which could not be identified to species are listed to the lowest taxonomic group possible.

The following text is verbatim from the Open data record. Species Distribution Models (SDM) were used to predict and identify priority areas for enhanced monitoring of cetaceans in eastern Canadian waters off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. This data set represents information presented in Gomez et al. (2020) and includes sighting records and SDM outputs for ten cetacean species with sufficient records (n > 450) and sightings only for an additional six species. For more information about sighting records including which were included in each SDM, please see Gomez et al. 2020. 
This study used a compilation of aerial- and vessel-based cetacean sightings data from 1975-2015 assembled in Gomez et al. (2017) from a variety of sources. Note that sightings data from many of these sources are not effort-corrected and apparent distribution patterns based on these opportunistic sightings data are biased by when and where survey activities were conducted. Unfavorable weather and reduced visual effort in winter, spring, and autumn likely account for the fewer sighting records in these seasons compared to summer. The dataset does not include dead animal, stranding, entanglement or entrapment data. While some of the databases include records obtained during the whaling period (catches or sightings recorded prior to 1975), for all analyses/modelling conducted in this study, only sightings of free-swimming whales obtained during the post-whaling period (1975-2015) were used. Quality control checks included discarding all records outside of our study area and removing redundant records (identical species, day, month, latitude and longitude).The data used do not reflect any updates or corrections to the databases that have occurred since the data were compiled in 2016. Sightings are not available for download here, please contact the original data sources listed below to obtain raw sightings data. 
This study represents an important initiative in eastern Canada to highlight key areas for cetacean monitoring in waters off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. Habitats with high suitability are interpreted as areas where cetacean monitoring efforts may be prioritized, and results can help direct future survey efforts. These model outputs used cetacean sightings from several decades and dynamic environmental predictors that used seasonal averages across multiple years. As proxies for prey availability, five predictor environmental variables were selected for the SDM: ocean depth, compound topographic index, sea surface temperature, areas of persistently high chlorophyll-a concentration, and regional chlorophyll-a magnitude. See Gomez et al. (2020) for further details on modelling methods. Persistent patterns over time (between 1975-2015) are the main patterns expected to be captured by these models. Further, SDM results presented here are not the same as species density maps; rather, they portray predicted suitable habitat based on environmental characteristics and sightings data that were not always derived from effort-based surveys. Consequently, the use of these models in marine spatial planning processes should be accompanied by complimentary approaches such as acoustic and visual validation of the SDM results as well as additional monitoring and modeling efforts. Please refer to Gomez et al. (2020) for examples on how to best use these data outputs. Future efforts will focus on using more recent data and improving these models to facilitate the inclusion of cetaceans in marine spatial planning processes that are currently underway.

Tier of confidence: **High**  

The following text is verbatim from the Open Data record. The distribution of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) is mainly dictated by key environmental drivers such as food requirements and availability, sea ice, and sometimes predation risks. It is common to find blue whales in upwelling regions, depending on topography (banks, slopes and shallow water) and thermal fronts, which are actually related to krill aggregations. Blue whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill) and have the highest absolute metabolic demands. A shapefile on the distribution of significant perennial areas of krill aggregation is available (DFO-ECCC). Important habitats for blue whales have therefore been identified by combining information on their distribution with krill aggregation areas (observed or predicted). In the waters of the St. Lawrence estuary, the presence of blue whales for foraging, feeding and migration has been observed throughout the year, with increased activity during the summer. It has been observed that feeding rates of blue whales are higher in shallow waters and during nocturnal periods (krill at surface), confirming that foraging near the surface is beneficial when possible. Their presence, their great fidelity to this important habitat for their activities and their behavior in the waters of the St. Lawrence in all seasons, show that blue whales are vulnerable to oil spills. They are vulnerable, not only indirectly through the reduction of prey and loss of suitable habitat, but also by their behavior requiring active activity on the surface and near the coast. The data used to create the polygons using the bounding box method comes from multiple sources of information: hunting records, photo-identification, coastal, airborne and boat surveys, passive acoustic monitoring, radio and satellite telemetry , ice trapping, anecdotal observations and modeling (please see a list of all sources of information used in Lesaqe et al. 2018 and the open data record <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/8fafd919-fcbe-43a3-a911-3d9461273441>).

## **Other Species Section**

Data products used in this section:

### **Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)**  
Contact: helpdesk@obis.org  
Site: <https://obis.org/>  
Last retrieved on: January 27 2021 from OBIS  
Tier of confidence: **Medium** 
Search year: xxxx
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat("Time frame:", "insert results from min and max year search function for this db.")
```

OBIS is a global open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation and sustainable development. Their vision is to build and maintain a global alliance that collaborates with scientific communities to facilitate free and open access to, and application of, biodiversity and biogeographic data and information on marine life. OBIS search was conducted to find additional relevant records for listed by SARA, or assessed by COSEWIC and Wild species listing. Subsequent versions of this report will aim at expanding our QC efforts for this source of information.

### **Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSA)**  
Contact: <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/d2d6057f-d7c4-45d9-9fd9-0a58370577e0>  
Tier of confidence: **High**  
Search year:  

Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs) are areas within Canada's oceans that have been identified through formal scientific assessments as having special biological or ecological significance when compared with the surrounding marine ecosystem.  

Failure to define an area as an EBSA does not mean that it is unimportant ecologically. All areas serve ecological functions to some extent and require sustainable management. Rather, areas identified as EBSAs should be viewed as the most important areas where, with existing knowledge, regulators and marine users should be particularly risk averse to ensure ecosystems remain healthy and productive.

# **Additional sources of information: to be included in future reports**

For information about seabirds please contact Environment and Climate Change Canada. Link: <https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/f612e2b4-5c67-46dc-9a84-1154c649ab4e>

There are sources of data and information that were not included in this report. These include data from past studies/publications, acoustic detections, prey sampling and tagging. While the value of these data in predicting and describing cetacean occurrence is vital, these types of data are not available for all species and are not yet available for data querying. In the future, as information from other data sources becomes available, it too will help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cetacean use and occurrence in the search areas.

Hi,

I apologize, but we can not provide you with the level of detail as it has been requested.  Fisheries catch and effort information for an individual licence holder is considered personal information and is protected under section 19 of the Access to Information Act. Fisheries catch and effort information for a corporate licence holder is considered to be sensitive, proprietary information and protected under Section 20 of the Access to Information Act.  Without written consent, DFO is not permitted to release information or data products (e.g., maps and data layers) that might reveal personal or third party information such as catch, landed values, and vessel-specific fishing locations.  All of this is spelled out to DFO staff the attached document (i.e. Appendix B – “Catch and Effort and Quota Information: Do’s and Don’ts for Informal Release”)
