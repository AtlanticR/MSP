###**Potential Exposure Zones (PEZs) polygon**

**Site:**
```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(AquaSiteName)
```
This report if for internal DFO use only. It was prepared by the MSP team for use in supporting a request Request for Review form for the x Project. A polygon representing the Predicted Exposure Zone (PEZ) was used to search regional databases (**2002 - 2018**) and summarize species that have been recorded. We recommend to share the species lists generated in this synthesis with DFO staff in CSAS Maritimes Science to verify and compliment the information provided (e.g. spatial and temporal presence/absence of species in the area). 

Map below shows the PEZ polygon (blue) used to search regional databases and summarize recorded species.

NOTE FOR DEVELOPMENT: WOULD BE IDEAL TO USE CSASDOWN FOR INTERNAL REPORTING FORMATTING 


```{r Fig 1 PEZ polygon, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
site_map(PEZ_poly,site,land,40)
```

# **Regional Databases**

```{r read csv extracted with previous chunck, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
fl <- list.files(dataPath,".csv")
marfis <- read.csv(file.path(dataPath,fl[grep("marfis_",fl)]))
marfis <- marfis[which(year(marfis$DATE_FISHED)>=minYear),]
isdb <- read.csv(file.path(dataPath,fl[grep("isdb_",fl)]))
isdb <- isdb[which(year(isdb$DATE_TIME2)>=minYear),]
rv <- read.csv(file.path(dataPath,fl[grep("rv_",fl)]))
rv <- rv[which(year(rv$SDATE)>=minYear),]  
```

### **Ecosystem Research Vessel (RV) Survey**

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) has conducted Research Vessel (RV) surveys in the Maritimes Region using a standardized protocol. For more information see <https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/4062092x.pdf>. The search of the Ecosystem RV Survey database resulted in the Table below that summarizes records by species or species group. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
rv$database <- "rv"
rv_freq <- aggregate(
        x = list(Records = rv$COMM),
      by = list(Species = rv$COMM
      ),
      length
      )
rv_freq <- rv_freq[order(-rv_freq$Records),]
rownames(rv_freq) <- c()
rv_total <- aggregate(
        x = list(total = rv$COMM),
      by = list(db = rv$database
      ),
      length
      )
Total_number_records_RV <- rv_total[[2]] 
Total_number_records_RV
```
```{r} 
kable(as.data.frame(Total_number_records_RV), digits=2, full_width = F, position = "left")
``` 
```{r}
kable(rv_freq) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```
Map below shows the location of sets performed in the Ecosystem RV Survey database (records for all sets displayed are summarized in the table above). The yellow polygon shows the locations of the theoretical site location. The blue polygon displays the PEZ used for this synthesis. 

```{r Fig 2 Ecosystem RV Survey records, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
site_map(PEZ_poly,site,land,2)
points(rv$LONGITUDE,rv$LATITUDE, col="black",pch=16,cex=1.5)
```

### **Industry Survey Database (ISDB)**

ISDB is a DFO database that contains at-sea fish catch observations from commercial fishing vessels operating in the North West Atlantic.

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
isdb$database <- "isdb"
isdb_freq <- aggregate(
        x = list(Records = isdb$COMMON),
      by = list(Species = isdb$COMMON
      ),
      length
      )
isdb_freq <- isdb_freq[order(-isdb_freq$Records),]
rownames(isdb_freq) <- c()

isdb_total <- aggregate(
  x = list(total = isdb$COMMON),
  by = list(db = isdb$database
  ),
  length
)

Total_number_records_ISDB <- isdb_total[[2]] 
Total_number_records_ISDB
```

The search of ISDB resulted in the Table below that summarizes records by species or species group. Records were cropped to match PEZ.


```{r} 
kable(as.data.frame(Total_number_records_ISDB), digits=2, full_width = F, position = "left")
``` 

```{r}
kable(isdb_freq) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```

### **The Maritime Fishery Information System (MARFIS)**

MARFIS is a DFO database, managed by the Policy & Economics Branch.

MARFIS is a database that contains: catch and effort, quota, and licensing information for the DFO Maritimes region. The catch and effort data contains the log information for all commercial fisheries that land within this region. If a Maritimes region commercial vessel lands in another DFO region or outside of Canadian waters, it is not included in the database. The majority of catch information is related to commercial offloads. There is also more limited data related to discards and the SARA log. Not all catch records have associated lat/long coordinates. This may be due to the structure of the log itself, or missing data. Generally all records have a NAFO Division and NAFO Unit Area flag, even if no coordinates have been provided.	Data for the years 2017-2020 is preliminary and subject to change without notice. There may be some limited changes to data in the years 2016 and previous. Ongoing qa/qc work is done on the MARFIS database, but not all errors are corrected.If you have data errors, questions, or corrections, you can send them to our data quality inbox: CDDDataQuality@dfo-mpo.gc.ca. Requests for data exports can be sent to: XMARComData@dfo-mpo.gc.ca. This information about MARFIS was provided by Colin.O'Neil@dfo-mpo.gc.ca (July 2020, Policy & Economics Branch).


```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
marfis$database <- "marfis"
marfis_freq <- aggregate(
        x = list(Records = marfis$SPECIES_NAME),
      by = list(Species = marfis$SPECIES_NAME
      ),
      length
      )
marfis_freq <- marfis_freq[order(-marfis_freq$Records),]
rownames(marfis_freq) <- c()

marfis_total <- aggregate(
  x = list(total = marfis$COMM),
  by = list(db = marfis$database
  ),
  length
)
Total_number_records_MARFIS <- marfis_total[[2]] 
Total_number_records_MARFIS 
```
The search of MARFIS resulted in the Table below that summarizes records by species or species group. Records were cropped to match PEZ.


```{r}
kable(as.data.frame(Total_number_records_MARFIS), digits=2, full_width = F, position = "float_left") 
```
```{r}
kable(marfis_freq) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "left")
```
Map below shows the location of samples recorded in the MARFIS and ISDB databases (records are summarized in the tables/sections above). The yellow polygon shows the locations of the theoretical site. The blue polygon displays the PEZ used for this synthesis. Records were cropped to match PEZ.

```{r Fig 3 MARFIS and ISDB records, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
site_map(PEZ_poly,site,land,2)
points(marfis$ENT_LONGITUDE,marfis$ENT_LATITUDE, col="black",pch=16,cex=0.5)
points(isdb$LONG2,isdb$LAT2, col="black",pch=16,cex=0.5)
```

### **Whale Sightings Database **
Whalesitings Database, Ocean and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Dartmouth, NS

Most sightings are collected on an opportunistic basis and observations may come from individuals with a variety of expertise in marine mammal identification experiences. Most data have been gathered from platforms of opportunity that were vessel-based. For more information see <https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40642999.pdf> or contact <XMARWhaleSightings@dfo-mpo.gc.ca>


Map below shows location of marine mammals sightings recorded in the Fisheries and Oceans whale sightings database. Map includes SARA and COSEWIC species within the region of interest. The yellow polygon shows the locations of the theoretical site. The blue polygon displays the PEZ used for this synthesis. 

```{r read wsdb and filter SARA & COSEWIC cetacean spp, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
wsdb <- read.csv(wsdbFile)
wsdb <- wsdb[which(year(as.Date(wsdb$WS_DATE,"%d-%b-%Y"))>=minYear),]
#wsdb <- remove_landPoints(wsdb,land)
wsdb_filter <- filter_wsdb(wsdb)
```
```{r Fig 4 Whale Sightings Database, fig.height=8, fig.width=11}
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar=c(0, 0, 5.5, 0) + 2)#it goes c(bottom, left, top, right)

### **Important Disclaimers for ISDB and MARFIS**

Please remember that fisheries catch and effort information:
1.         for an individual licence holder is considered personal information and is protected under section 19 of the Access to Information Act <https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-12>. 
2.         for a corporate licence holder is considered to be sensitive, proprietary information and protected under Section 20 of the Access to Information Act <https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-1/page-5.html#h-13>.  
Without written consent, DFO is not permitted to release information or data products (e.g., maps and data layers) that might reveal personal or third party information such as catch, landed values, and vessel-specific fishing locations.  All of this is spelled out to DFO staff here - Informal Release Guidelines (i.e. Appendix B – “Catch and Effort and Quota Information: Do’s and Don’ts for Informal Release” <\\ent.dfo-mpo.ca\ATLShares\Shared\ATIP Information\Informal_Release_Guidelines-eng.docx>).

The reproducible reporting tool is for internal use only. Please do not release data you should not. If in doubt, check with your supervisor.

Should you receive a request for set-level Observer data (ISDB) and MARFIS, please just forward to Peter Comeau and <XMARComData@dfo-mpo.gc.ca>, respectively. Please feel free to use the email template below. Note that the template includes an attachment which you can download here - Informal Release Guidelines <\\ent.dfo-mpo.ca\ATLShares\Shared\ATIP Information\Informal_Release_Guidelines-eng.docx>. If you are including observer data in a publication, please remember to aggregate it.  If you need help doing so, Mike McMahon has a handy R script that can help you. Ask him - he loves to talk about his scripts. 

TLDR; Please do not share set-level observer data (ISDB) and MARFIS with external (non-DFO) people.  

Hi,

I apologize, but we can not provide you with the level of detail as it has been requested.  Fisheries catch and effort information for an individual licence holder is considered personal information and is protected under section 19 of the Access to Information Act. Fisheries catch and effort information for a corporate licence holder is considered to be sensitive, proprietary information and protected under Section 20 of the Access to Information Act.  Without written consent, DFO is not permitted to release information or data products (e.g., maps and data layers) that might reveal personal or third party information such as catch, landed values, and vessel-specific fishing locations.  All of this is spelled out to DFO staff the attached document (i.e. Appendix B – “Catch and Effort and Quota Information: Do’s and Don’ts for Informal Release”). 

It may be possible to provide you instead with an aggregated product that combines the information for at least five different licence holders, licences, or vessels.  Please feel free to contact us again if you need help modifying your request such that it meets these specifications while still being useful in answering your questions. 


### **Sources of Uncertainty**

Coastal areas and offshore the Scotian Shelf are generally not adequately sampled, and hence information on these space and time scales is generally not contained within the various data sources available to DFO, including the surveys referred to in this document. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to the exact distribution of species in the area of the theoretical site.

MARFIS and ISDB do not fully sample the region spatially or temporally and, therefore, additional information on presence and habitat use (i.e. spawning, migration, feeding) must be drawn from larger-scale studies. 

Please note the following caveats regarding data in the Whale Sightings Database: 

- The sighting data have not yet been completely error-checked. 

- The quality of some of the sighting data is unknown. Most sightings are collected on an opportunistic basis and observations may come from individuals with a variety of expertise in marine mammal identification experiences. 

- Most data have been gathered from platforms of opportunity that were vessel-based. The inherent problems with negative or positive reactions by cetaceans to the approach of such vessels have not yet been factored into the data 

- Sighting effort has not been quantified (i.e., the numbers cannot be used to estimate true species density or abundance for an area). Lack of sightings do not represent lack of species present in a particular area 

- Numbers sighted have not been verified (especially in light of the significant differences in detectability among species). 

- For completeness, the data represent an amalgamation of sightings from a variety of years and seasons. Effort (and number of sightings) is not necessarily consistent among months, years, and areas. There are large gaps between years. Thus seasonal, depth, and distributional information should not be considered definitive. 

- Many sightings could not be identified to species, but are listed to the smallest taxonomic group possible
