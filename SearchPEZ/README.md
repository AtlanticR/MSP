Regional Database Search by Potential Exposure Zone (PEZ) polygons

The aquaculture Science group led by Fred Page works with the Aquaculture site information, including current meter data, to calculate the Potential Exposure Zones (PEZ) of the aquaculture inputs (depositional feed/feces, advective/dispersive fish health treatments, etc.). This PEZ polygon is then used by this repository to search regional databases and summarize species that have been recorded. This information is used to determine if other, more site-specific, information is available on species presence for PEZ as a complement to the information provided by the proponent. Species lists generated in this synthesis is subsequently circulated to units in PED to verify and compliment the information provided (e.g. spatial and temporal presence/absence of species in the area).
